# colag-Language
Colag (Combination of All Languages) is a new experimental programming language that combines the best features and syntax styles from multiple popular languages like Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, and more â€” into one unified, simple, and flexible language.
Colag aims to:
- Make coding easier by letting developers use familiar syntax from any major language
- Simplify learning for beginners
- Provide flexibility and power for advanced users

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features (Planned)

- Multi-syntax support (e.g., Python-style, C++-style)
- Dynamic and static typing
- Easy-to-read, easy-to-write
- Unified compiler/interpreter backend
- Interoperability with other languages

## ðŸ§ª Early Syntax Ideas

```colag
print("Hello, World!")       # Python style
System.out.println("Hi");    // Java style
cout << "Hey";               // C++ style
